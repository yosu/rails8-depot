      <em>The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide</em>
      Ruby is one of the most important programming languages in use for web
      development. It powers the Rails framework, which is the backing of some
      of the most important sites on the web. The Pickaxe Book, named for the
      tool on the cover, is the definitive reference on Ruby, a
      highly-regarded, fully object-oriented programming language. This updated
      edition is a comprehensive reference on the language itself, with a
      tutorial on the most important features of Ruby—including pattern
      matching and Ractors—and describes the language through Ruby 3.3.

      <em>Practical Techniques for Performance and Growth</em>
      Rails doesn’t scale. So say the naysayers. They’re wrong. Ruby on Rails
      runs some of the biggest sites in the world, impacting the lives of
      millions of users while efficiently crunching petabytes of data. This
      book reveals how they do it, and how you can apply the same techniques
      to your applications. Optimize everything necessary to make an
      application function at scale: monitoring, product design, Ruby code,
      software architecture, database access, caching, and more. Even if your
      app may never have millions of users, you reduce the costs of hosting
      and maintaining it.
